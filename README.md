🌍 OpenAQ Lalbagh Weather & Air Quality Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **OpenAQ Lalbagh dataset**, which contains **weather and air quality measurements** from the Lalbagh region.
Using **Python, Pandas, and YData Profiling**, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was performed to uncover patterns, correlations, and key insights from the data.

 🚀 Project Overview

* Loaded and explored the OpenAQ Lalbagh dataset
* Generated a **comprehensive profiling report** using `ydata_profiling`
* Identified trends in weather parameters and pollutant levels
* Detected missing values and correlations
* Exported results into an **interactive HTML report**


 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** 🐍
* **Pandas**
* **YData Profiling** (formerly Pandas Profiling)
* (Optional) **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization


## 📂 Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository

   cd openaq-lalbagh-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install pandas ydata-profiling
   ```

3. Run the script

   ```bash
   python analyze.py
   ```

4. Open the generated **HTML report** in your browser:

   ```

## 📈 Key Insights

* ✅ Weather parameter distributions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
* ✅ Pollutant level analysis (PM2.5, PM10, etc.)
* ✅ Correlation between weather conditions and air quality
* ✅ Missing data detection and handling suggestions

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Extend analysis with **time-series visualizations**
* Apply **forecasting models** (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) for air quality prediction
* Compare Lalbagh data with **other OpenAQ locations**

---

## 📑 Learnings

* Automated dataset profiling with YData Profiling
* Exploratory analysis of real-world weather & air quality data
* Handling missing values and understanding correlations
